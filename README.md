# react-floating-label-input

This is a floating label component for React. It inherits the font-size from the parent so you can easily set the desired input font-size in your own CSS. It also accepts a shrink property which can be 1-99 inclusive. That is the percentage to shrink the floating label when the input is focused or has a value.
